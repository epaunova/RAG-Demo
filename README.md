# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Quick-Start Demo

**Author – Eva Paunova • June 2025**  
Minimal, end-to-end example that shows how to:

1. Ingest unstructured docs  
2. Chunk and embed them with **Hugging Face**  
3. Store vectors in **pgvector** (PostgreSQL)  
4. Query via **LangChain RetrievalQA**  
5. Capture latency & cost metrics

The notebook is designed as a **take-home / interview demo**: recruiters can run it in < 10 min on a laptop or Colab.
